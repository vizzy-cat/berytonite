# Berytonite

Berytonite is a modern cryptography library for the C programming language—designed to be lightweight, secure, and developer-friendly. It aims to be a clean and minimal alternative to legacy libraries like OpenSSL, focusing on essential cryptographic primitives without the bloat.

With a clear API, modular structure, and cross-platform compatibility, Berytonite offers the tools C developers need—without sacrificing simplicity or control.
