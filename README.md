# Krypton

Krypton is a modern cryptography library for the C programming language, designed to be lightweight, secure, and developer-friendly. It serves as a clean and minimal alternative to legacy libraries like OpenSSL, providing essential cryptographic primitives without the bloatâ€”offering a clear API, modular structure, and cross-platform support.

Please note: Krypton is still under active development and not yet production-ready. The API may change, features may be incomplete, and security has not been fully audited. Use with caution and follow updates as the project evolves.
