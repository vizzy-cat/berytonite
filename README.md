# Krypton

Krypton is a modern cryptography library for the C programming language, designed to be lightweight, secure, and developer-friendly. It serves as a clean and minimal alternative to legacy libraries like OpenSSL, providing essential cryptographic primitives without the bloatâ€”offering a clear API, modular structure, and cross-platform support.

## Development Pace

Krypton is being developed during spare time as a passion project. While updates may not be frequent, every commit is made with care and attention to detail. Progress may be slow, but the long-term goal remains: to create a reliable and modern cryptographic library tailored for C developers who value clarity, simplicity, and control.

Community contributions, feedback, and ideas are always welcome!
